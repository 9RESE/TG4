Strategies:
- btc and xrp usdt pairs- 9 week moving average on the 5 min and 1 hour. One candle opposite the trend the trend close position. 2 candles closed above/below the 9 is a trend(the equation for a trend is not a set definition and is open to improvement)
- does xrp follow btc predictably enough to trade on?

I want to develop these strategies.
